MARCH 19:
    Today in class we used the euclidian distance formula to calculate the distance between neighbors(k nearest neighbors).
    We first used all of the points of the dataset for each car model to compare to each model so that we could get
    the variance of that. We then removed data points that changed the variance to get better approximation of our nearest
    neighbors.
